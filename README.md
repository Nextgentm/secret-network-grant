## Project Description
![Lootmogul Demo - Build your own metaverse land](https://lootmogul.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-content.lootmogul.com%2FCreate_Land_2_1440x600_dc8b092056_095d617610.webp&w=3840&q=75)

LootMogul is an influencer-led sports metaverse gaming platform powered by exclusive properties (Lands, Stadium, Arenas, etc.), NFTs, and token rewards for the fans and business community.

There are three key stakeholders in the Lootmogul community:

**Sports athletes (influencers)** engage with their fans in local stadiums, arenas, playgrounds, etc. through multiplayer blockchain sports games (basketball, football, soccer, baseball, pickleball, etc.) and In-Real-Life (IRL) rewards (Shoes, fitness wear, event ticket & passes, etc.)

**Fans** enjoy an immersive experience with influencers by playing games with sports athletes' avatars, forming dream teams (ex. Larry Bird playing against Shaq), and competing at a global level.

**Land Owners** earn revenue from ticket sales, game revenue, NFT revenue, and brand sponsorship.

LootMogul has first mover advantage in this fast-growing $800B industry and has partnered with more than 120 professional athletes from NBA, NFL, MLB, eSports, ICC, etc., and 1.5M+ high-school and college athletes.

LootMogul is expanding the web3 community by bringing web 2 gamers and sports fanatics to the metaverse with a play-to-earn model, real-world perks, experiences, and NFT collections.

Companies or Gaming guilds can own or lease NFT stadiums, seats, banners, celebrity avatars, game power, wearables etc. for their community and scholars at 25% to 75% discount with 4% APY during the pre-sale events and mega launch parties such as NBA all-star weekend, NFL Superbowl, World Championship etc.

Finally, LootMogul's seed round is funded by billion-dollar web 3 crypto companies and web 2 traditional equity venture funds - Harmony, PowerHouse Ventures, BCT, and u2poia with grants from Polygon and Sandbox. Our token round of investments are going to be lead by Woodstock, SL2 Capital, Animoca Brands and others.

We intend to create a staking derivatives on Secret Network. More implementations will increase capital efficiecy in Secret Network and enable SCRT staked to secure Secret Network to be used in other Secret Network applications such as DeFi, governance and games.

Our team has been closely following Ethereum DeFi and Secret Network in the last year, and are active in the chat channels. Needless to say, we are really excited to see this project evolve.

#### Architecture

## Problem / Solution
**Problem** : Sport's athletes do not have opportunity to build community, engagement, monetize and be part of metaverse. They are unable to capitalize their global fan engagement etc.

##### Solution

## Detailed product description
The components of staking derivatives (dxSCRT) contract include a validator set module that determines validator participation, staking module which handles bonded tokens and liquidity pool.

## Go-to-Market plan
As dxSCRT is a clear value proposition for existing SCRT holders, we hope to promote this effort within the Secret Network community

## Value capture for Secret Network ecosystem
The main KPIs for Secret Network is TVL (privacy value add to other blockchain ecosystems), number of transactions and number of user (for applications)
